  Section 1: "What is Magento?"
    Sales summmary (1 slide): 
      - "A fully-featured, market-tested eCommerce Platform that's built to be a flexible framework for Commerce."
        - Can serve as either an end-to-end commerce application or a reference application within a larger business landscape
        - Modular and flexible with a extensive API built in REST and GraphQL
        - Used with a variety of heads -- anything from Wordpress to Drupal to AEM and others.
    Magento Platform Capabilities (1 slide):
      - Brief overview of the native features that Magento delivers and our approach to customization
  Section 2: "Magento and Headless"
    What We Mean By Headless:
      - Being headless provides different value propositions depending on who's asking for the definition.
        - For business users, it's the ability to combine functionality from several business systems into a single CMS.
        - For developers, it allows separating business logic from the frontend tech stack so that they can develop the frontend they need using whatever tech stack they believe works best for them.
      Magento can function in both of these worlds: 
        - We deliver a fully-featured application with a mature frontend.
        - We deliver a mature API that covers a breadth of commerce functionality, and can be expanded as needed.
        - We deliver a component-based frontend architecture that can be used to create Progressive Web Apps (ReactJS).
        - Other component-based approaches are also available if desired (VueJS)
    Headless Deployment Approaches:
      Fully Headless:
        - The experience is rendered as a Single Page Application which is built using a unified set of Javascript components. Each piece of the experience is owned by a different provider and delivered to the SPA frontend;
        - The experience is rendered by the primary CMS. The CMS is made aware of domain-specific elements via API. (E.g. product reccs from Bloomreach, Cart from eComm, content from CMS)
      Side-by-side:
        - Different storefront experiences (pages) are rendered by different applications and routed to via URL
        - The application which owns each page is determined based on the purpose that page serves as well as how often the content on that page is planned to be updated by business users.
          - Ex. Shopping cart is commerce-focused and minimally updated (Commerce)
          - Ex. Product Detail pages are commerce-focused, and not frequently updated (Commerce)
          - Ex. The Homepage is brand and content-focused and frequently updated (CMS)
          - Ex. Category Listing pages are a mix of commerce and content and are frequently updated (CMS)
        - Functionality owned by different back-office systems is integrated with the application that owns each experience via API.  Sometimes multiple integrations between one back-office system may be needed.
          - Ex. Integration with a tax service is commerce-focused and would be handled via a connector to Magento Commerce.
          - Ex. Search and merchandising (Product Reccs) are owned by Bloomreach and displayed on both Product Detail pages and Category Listing pages.  Magento owns the product catalog and displays the PDP, so an integration between Bloomreach and Magento is needed.  Drupal owns the CLP, so a further integration between Bloomreach and Drupal would also be needed to display Bloomreach content from Magento in pages owned by Drupal.

  Section 4: "Proposed Solution for DFC"
    Business Use Case:
        Insight: Spring is fast approaching and is a prime time for home remodelling projects.  DFC wants to capitalize on this by releasing a new product collection and targeting customers who are looking to remodel their homes.
        Initiative: The Re-Modeller Campaign
            Step 1: Define target customers
            Step 2: Create a New Product collection
            Step 3: Merchandise products in the collection
            Step 4: Use a promotion to incentivize purchase of products
            Step 5: Create content to advertise the collection and its promotions
            Step 6: Preview and launch the campaign

          Story: Bob and his wife, Jeanne are in the market to build their first home, and have reached the point where it's time to choose fixtures. They've settled on Delta after running into some models at a friend's house. Normally, Bob would head to Home Depot to purchase fixtures; however, the couple has also just found out that they're having their first child in a matter of months, so saving money is especially top of mind. Not wanting to sacrifice on quality, Bob wonders if Delta sells direct, and if he might go the refurbished route.

          Name: Bob and his wife, Jeanne -- retiring home owners ready for a re-model
          Story: Bob is set to retire soon and he and his wife, Jeanne, are looking to remodel their kitchen and bathroom. Bob starts a search for fixtures because he hasn’t paid attention to them in years! He notices that most of his searches feature Delta’s products and he’s interested to see their Outlet store as he believes it'll give him a high-quality, stylish product from a brand he can trust, at a price he knows he can afford.
